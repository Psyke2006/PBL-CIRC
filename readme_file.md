## Problem Statement

Conventional chatbots are limited to text or voice-based interactions and lack the ability to process and understand visual information. This creates a gap in human-computer interaction where users cannot effectively communicate contextual information through images. There is a need for an AI-based conversational chatbot that integrates image recognition with natural language processing, enabling more intuitive, intelligent, and human-like interactions for applications in diverse domains such as education, healthcare, and customer support.

---

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to develop a conversational chatbot that integrates image recognition with natural language processing. A convolutional neural network (CNN) will analyze images and extract features, which are combined with user queries to generate context-aware responses. This approach enables intelligent and human-like interaction with the system.

## Features

- 📸 **Image Upload:** Support for JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing:** Text-based query understanding
- 🤖 **Context-Aware Responses:** Combines visual and textual information
- 🎨 **Modern UI:** Clean and intuitive chat interface
- ⚡ **Real-time Processing:** Fast response generation
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/conversational-image-chatbot.git
cd conversational-image-chatbot
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Create Required Directories
```bash
mkdir uploads
mkdir static/css
mkdir static/js
mkdir templates
```

### Step 5: Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start at `http://localhost:5000`

---

## Usage

1. **Open the Application:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
2. **Upload an Image:** Click the "Upload Image" button and select an image file
3. **Ask a Question:** Type your question about the image in the text input
4. **Get Response:** The chatbot will analyze the image and respond to your query

---

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/upload`
Upload an image with a text query

**Request:**
- Method: POST
- Content-Type: multipart/form-data
- Body:
  - `image`: Image file (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
  - `query`: Text query string

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "filename": "20251016_123456_image.jpg",
  "query": "What objects are in this image?",
  "response": "Based on the image analysis...",
  "timestamp": "20251016_123456"
}
```

### POST `/api/chat`
Send a text-only message

**Request:**
```json
{
  "message": "Hello, how can you help me?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Hello, how can you help me?",
  "response": "Hello! I'm your conversational image recognition assistant..."
}
```
